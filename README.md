## Introduction

This repository provides examples of OOP concepts implemented in C#. Each example demonstrates a specific concept and provides a clear understanding of how to use it in your own projects.

## Examples

### Example 1: Multiple Level Inheritance

This example showcases the concept of multiple level inheritance in C#. It demonstrates how classes can be derived from other classes, forming a hierarchical structure of inheritance.

### Example 2: MLS with Animal Hierarchy

This example demonstrates the concept of Multiple Level Inheritance (MLS) using an animal hierarchy. It shows how classes can be derived from each other to represent different levels of abstraction and specialization.
